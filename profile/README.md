**Panic Disorder** was estimated to have a global prevalence of around **2-3%** in the general population, **1** in every **8** people, or **970** **million** people around the world were living with a **Panic Disorder**, So we decided to develop a solution that take care of people who experience panic  attacks, panic disorders or normal people who want to increase their  awareness of this disease in particular or mental health in general, and  for people who are classified as suffering from panic attacks

**Panicless** is a proposed model for Panic Attack detection and prediction using AI and IoT technologies, the system can be used through the mobile app, **Panicless** has 2 meanings, Panic is tough, Less is to terminate that Panic.

## System Architecture

Our system consists of two parts:

- **Hardware (Vest)**: The  vest should be worn around the heart or chest area and can help us in **Detection** process when a panic attack is coming, this vest equipped with three sensors for **heart rate**, vibration measurement for **trembling rate**, and pressure sensitivity measurement for **breathing rate**, we have used this type of vest to be comfortable and practical to wear for the user.

- **Software(PanicLess)** : If the patient is experiencing a panic attack, the application takes over. It allows the patient to deal with the panic attack by starting an automatic  relaxation session, which helps them feel that they are not alone.  Additionally, the patient can call someone they trust who can help  them in the moment, also a **chatbot** designed to assist in the **Prediction** process of  determining whether a user is experiencing a panic disorder or not.
