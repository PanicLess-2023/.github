Our system consist of two parts:

1. **Hardware ( Vest ) **
we used this vest in our project, equipped with three sensors for heart rate, vibration
measurement for trembling rate, and pressure sensitivity measurement for breathing rate, we have used this type of vest to be comfortable and practical to wear for the user.

2. ** Software (Mobile App) **
we want to help people who experience panic attacks, so we decided to create a mental health app called **PANICLESS** to take care of people who experience panic attacks, panic disorders or normal people who want to increase their awareness of this disease in particular or mental health in general.
